== Suppressed Messages ==

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples

# === "The deprecation [of this valueset] in R5 was erroneous." -- https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179165-committers/topic/deprecated.20valueset/near/418829938 ===
# The message is coming from the base ActorDefinition resource
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0

# === Extension is inherited, no control over it.
%The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated%

# === ValueSet for subscription notification is not available in R4, it is added to this IG
Binding http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/subscription-notification-type could not be located

# === CodeSystem for task code is now active, and the binding is extensible. Warning is not applicable
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/task-code|4.0.1

# === OID assignment for ActorDefinition profiles is not intended in the first ballot
The resource ActorDefinition/filler could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)
The resource ActorDefinition/placer could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)

# === These code systems are only for examples, THO alignment is premature
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
