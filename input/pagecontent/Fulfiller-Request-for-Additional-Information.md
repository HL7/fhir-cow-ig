## Fulfiller Requests for Additional Information

Fulfillers commonly find they need additional information to  perform a service or to confirm that they're able to perform a service. This section describes the general mechanisms by which a (potential) fulfiller
can request supplemental information, and how such requests can be reflected in the status tracking for the request. These flows can be complicated in their own right and details are beyond the scope of this IG: the below
is intended as informative guidance.

At a high level, a fulfiller can request additional information by:
* Executing a real-time query against the placer to see whether the information of interest is already available. For example - query for the patient's current medication's list.  
* Sending a letter to the placer asking for additional information. In these cases, the response by the placer is asynchronous, as it requires user action at the placer system to respond. The status of the request should be
updated to reflect that the fulfiller is awaiting information. 
* A fulfiller may even send an instruction back to the placer. This could instruct that they work with the patient to complete a questionnaire, that they collect some consent, or that they have another service performed
ahead of the main service. For example, a surgeon may ask that certain labs be performed ahead of a surgical consult. 

TODO - confirm under who's authority these types of requests happen.
