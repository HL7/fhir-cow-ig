#### Workflow Description

This example assumes that actors have already pre-coordinated business agreements, client registration, etc. 

In this flow, a patient and their provider are attempting to determine how a patient should receive skilled nursing and other care post discharge. Once the patient knows what 
options are available, they may select a skilled nursing facility based on several criteria, not all of which need be healthcare related: the patient may decide they liked staff they spoke with, 
that a particular facility would be more convenient for their family to visit, etc.
