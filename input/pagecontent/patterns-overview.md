### Section overview ###
This section describes several high-level patterns of interaction for order, referral, and transfer workflows, with a brief description of clinial scenarios in which they may apply.The set of interaction patterns described is not exhaustive: this IG uses them as a starting ponit to provide context in the subsequent discussions, and as a way to demonstrate the shared features of these exchanges.

### The patterns described are:
* A simple order, in which a placer creates a request and they are confident a specific performer will fulfill it.
* A simple referral, in which a placer creates a request for a specific intended performer, but the selected performer may decline.
* A request that may be broadcasted to several potential perfomers, in which any of them may claim the request.
* A request sent to many potential performers, where the requestor and patient will then review information sent back by the performers before selecting a definite performer.
* A request to a central coordinator who will assign the request to a performer, and notify the requestor of who will fulfill the request.
* TODO: A request to a central coordinator, who will assign the request to a performer and additionally mediate further communication between the requestor and performer.
* A request authorized by a prescriber, which a patient then uses to seek service at a place of their choosing.
