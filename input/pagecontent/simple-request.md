In the most simple flow, a providdr creates a request, and instructs a fulfiller that they should perform it. The fulfiller may be confident in this scenario , based on pre-coordinated buisiness and IT agreements, that the performer won't decline the request.

Based on the workflow of interest, the performer may or may not notify the requestor of an 'outcome' at a later time.
