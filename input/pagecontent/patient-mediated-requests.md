Many orders and referrals take the form that a provider 'authorizes' that care with another provider may occur, but the patient (or their agent) then manages the coordination of that care. Once the patient has selected a performer, that performer may wish to query additional information (including the authorization) and to share information with the original requestor. 

Examples:
* In community prescriptions, the Patient usually chooses a Pharmacy.
* A requestor may indicate that a blood draw should occur for a patient. The patient may choose for themselves to which lab they will present (perhaps one lab is on their commute between their home and work).
* A provider may determine that a patient would benefit from receiving care in a long term care facility, and authorize that level of service. The patient and their family may consider several care facilities before deciding which they like.
* A patient may discuss with their primary care provider that they would like to see a specialist, such as OB/MFM, an orthopedist, a psychologist, etc. The GP may authorize this service without having a specific performer in mind, and may rely on the patient to then find a specialist.
