Implementers often consider how to give to the order filler all the information that is necessary to execute the order.

How to make that information available depends on a few aspects:

* Whether that information is limited and can be determined upfront?
* The relationship between order Placer and order Fulfiller (for that specific order context)



1. Assemble the content and make it available



2. CDEX-type query



3. Permission definition
