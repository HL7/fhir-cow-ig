When a reqeustor can't be certain of whether the fulfiller will be willing to perform a service (based on availability, insurance, etc.), they may ask the fulfiller to confirm that they accept the proposed service.

If the performer declines to perform the service (or fails to respond within a pre-coordinated period), the requestor may choose to follow up with other potential performers.
