### Fulfiller Modifications

Some workflows allow a fulfiller to modify a request without prior approval from the proposal. For example:

* A fulfiller may receive a general request to perform some service, and may then choose themselves which specific service should be performed.

* A fulfiller may apply their own expertise to determine that an alternative service is more appropriate, and may initiate this on behalf of the original placer and under their authorityu.

* A fulfiller may attempt to fulfill the requested service, but find that it can't be done due to the patient's condition or some other factor. In this case, they may complete a partial or alternative service.
