# Cancellations Initiated by Fulfiller

A Placer and a Fulfiller may have business agreements that allow a Fulfiller to decline to perform a request, possibly up to certain points in the workflow or to suggest that a request be cancelled in its entirety.

## Declining to Perform a Request

TODO - add content 
Task.status / Task.businessStatus
Task.output 

## Proposing a Modification or Cancellation to the Request:

Task.Output - Plan? Proposal? Just a note?
